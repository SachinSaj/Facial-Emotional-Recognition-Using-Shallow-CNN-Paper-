# Paper Facial-Emotional-Recognition-Using-Shallow-CNN

### Abstract

Facial emotional recognition became an important task in
the modern day scenario to understand the state of emotions of a human
being by machines. With the development of computational power
and deep learning techniques, facial emotion recognition (FER) became
feasible, which contributed to a wide range of applications in modern
day technology. In this paper, we propose a shallow convolutional neural
network architecture with feature-based data, which can do this task
more eectively and attained the state-of-the-art accuracy with less computational
complexity (in terms of learnable parameters). The proposed
architecture is shallow and gives comparable performance with all the
existing approaches for FER in deep learning

### Code


- This Notebook, deals with facial emotional recognition.
- The dataset used is JAFFE facial emotional dataset
- This dataset consists of 7 facial emotions such as anger, disgust, happy, sad, fear, joy and neutral
- The classification accuracy achieved by the shallow CNN, designed by me was able to achieve same state of the art accuracy of 90.3%, with lesser number of convolution layers (lesser number of learnable parameters) used.
- The result was published in " Symposium on Machine Learning and Metaheuristics Algorithms, and Applications (SoMMA'19) "


** Details of the project is given in this repository, in the form of Paper and Presentation.
