# Facial-Emotional-Recognition-Using-Shallow-CNN-Paper-

- This Notebook, deals with facial emotional recognition.
- The dataset used is JAFFE facial emotional dataset
- This dataset consists of 7 facial emotions such as anger, disgust, happy, sad, fear, joy and neutral
- The classification accuracy achieved by the shallow CNN, designed by me was able to achieve same state of the art accuracy of 90.3%, with lesser number of convolution layers (lesser number of learnable parameters) used.
- The result was published in " Symposium on Machine Learning and Metaheuristics Algorithms, and Applications (SoMMA'19) "
